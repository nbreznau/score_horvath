## Overview

A replication of Horvat and Evans ([2011](https://doi.org/10.1093/esr/jcq033)) as part of [SCORE](https://www.cos.io/score)

Read the [final report](../main/Breznau_SCORE_Final_Report.pdf) as a PDF document.

The workflow consists of ordered (numbered) Rmd files. To see the code and results in-line simply click on the html files. 

Note that because R and Stata results differed, the finaly replication results are from Stata (see .do file) as this was also what the original authors used. 

## Data Sources

The original combined data file is publicly available. It is a combination of a 2007 survey wave from:

*Whitefield, S. and G. Evans (2007). EUREQUAL 2007: Design, Data Description and Documentation, Oxford University.*

And an earlier wave spanning the mid 1990s from:

*Loveless, Matthew (2009). EUREQUAL 1993-2007 Survey Codebook and Questionnaire, University of Oxford* and
*Evans, G., S Whitefield, A Heath, C Payne (1993). Emerging Forms of Political Representation and Participation in Eastern Europe. (Data deposited at ESRC data archive, Essex.)*

The data are located in the [data](../main/data) folder in the project repository and can be obtained from  [EUREQUAL (Data) - ORA - Oxford University Research Archive](https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:cda668b8-a583-43c7-9919-35c0a18db571). Please cite EUREQUAL and the above studies even if you take the data from this repository.
